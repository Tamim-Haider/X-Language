# X-Language
X Language is a custom-designed programming language created to explore how programming languages are structured and how syntax rules define program behavior. It uses a unique, developer-defined syntax, allowing greater control over how instructions are written and executed.

The language was developed as a learning-focused project to understand core concepts such as language design, parsing, syntax rules, and execution flow. X Language demonstrates how high-level programming concepts can be translated into a custom syntax while maintaining logical consistency and readability.

The project highlights creativity in language design and provides insight into how modern programming languages are built internally. X Language can be extended further with additional features such as variables, control structures, functions, and error handling.
